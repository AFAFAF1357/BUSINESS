        <h1>To be or not to be a VAT&#160;payer</h1>
        <div class="Summary">
            <p class="Akapitzlistą_1" style="font-weight: normal;font-size: 12pt;" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;In a nutshell: &lt;/b&gt;">&#160;</p>
            <p class="Akapitzlistą_1" style="font-weight: normal;font-size: 12pt;">You need to check whether you are required to register as a VAT payer. If you are not, you can still choose a voluntary VAT registration.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="Akapitzlistą_3">VAT is&#160; added to the price of a product or a service. It is due irrespective of your income tax and regardless of the taxation form that you chose. As a rule, a business should be registered for VAT.</p>
        <p class="Akapitzlistą_3">&#160;</p>
        <p class="Akapitzlistą_3">You must be a VAT payer, if you sell the following types of products or services:</p>
        <p class="Akapitzlistą_1">Goods:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>goods listed in Annex 12 to the VAT Act (e.g. precious metals and their scrap, jewelery)</li>
            <li>goods subject to excise tax, with the exception of: electricity, tobacco products and passenger cars other than new ones, that pursuant to the provisions on income tax are classified as fixed assets subject to depreciation</li>
            <li>in certain cases: buildings, structures or parts thereof</li>
            <li>construction sites</li>
            <li>new means of transport</li>
            <li>goods sold on the Internet: cosmetics and toilet preparations</li>
            <li>computers, electronic and optical products</li>
            <li>electrical and non-electric household appliances</li>
            <li>machinery and equipment not classified elsewhere</li>
            <li>parts for motor vehicles and motorcycles</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Services:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>legal services</li>
            <li>advisory services (except agricultural advisory)</li>
            <li>jewelry</li>
            <li>debt collection, including factoring</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Akapitzlistą_3">If this is your case, you are required to register as a VAT payer.</p>
        <p class="Akapitzlistą_7">If your activity is not listed in the table above, you can be exempt from VAT in any of the following situations:</p>
        <ul class="ul_1">
            <li class="Akapitzlistą_2">
                <p class="Akapitzlistą_7">Your sales volume does not exceed PLN 200,000 a year</p>
                <p class="Akapitzlistą_7">If you are starting a business, you do not have any sales yet, so you do not need to register for VAT. </p>
                <p class="Akapitzlistą_7">Once you start business, you need to monitor your sales, to be aware of when the limit is exceeded. Then you will be required to register for VAT. </p>
                <p class="Akapitzlistą_7">The above limit is an annual one. If you start your business in mid-year, it shall be calculated proportionally. For example, if you start business on 1 July, your proportionate limit will be PLN 100,000 (corresponding to the 6 months that you will be in business).</p>
            </li>
            <li class="Akapitzlistą_1">
                <p class="Akapitzlistą_4">You sell only VAT-exempt goods or services.</p>
                <p class="Akapitzlistą_4">The most popular of them are medical services, educational services, teaching foreign languages, financial services. The detailed list of such goods and services can be found in Article 43 (1) of the <a href="https://isap.sejm.gov.pl/isap.nsf/DocDetails.xsp?id=WDU20040540535" target="_blank">VAT&#160;Act</a>.</p>
                <p class="Akapitzlistą_4">If you plan to offer any of such services only, they will not be subject to VAT, even if you exceed the PLN 200,000.*</p>
                <p class="Akapitzlistą_4">&#160;</p>
                <div class="Remember">
                    <p class="Akapitzlistą_4" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Remember: &lt;/b&gt;"> </p>
                    <p class="Akapitzlistą_4">You can voluntarily register for VAT, even if you are exempt. This might be profitable, as this will give you an opportunity to deduct VAT that you pay on your purchases.</p>
                </div>
                <p class="Akapitzlistą_4">&#160;</p>
                <p>If you are not eligible for the exemption, you should register as VAT payer. Use the VAT-R form.</p>
                <p>You can do it when registering your business in CEIDG.</p>
                <p>You can choose one of the two options:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Register as an active VAT payer</li>
                    <li>Register as a VAT-exempt payer – you can file the VAT-R form, but it is not obligatory.</li>
                </ul>
                <div class="Remember">
                    <p MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Remember: &lt;/b&gt;">&#160;</p>
                    <p>You can file the VAT-R form only if you have the NIP number.</p>
                </div>
            </li>
        </ul>
