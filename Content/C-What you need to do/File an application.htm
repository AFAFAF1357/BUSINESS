        <h1>File an application</h1>
        <p>Once you have prepared the required information and documents, you can proceed to filling in your registration application.</p>
        <h2>Access the registration application</h2>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/AccessSnippet.flsnp" />
        <h2>Fill in the registration application</h2>
        <p>The detailed guide on how to fill in individual fields is available <a href="../Express path/Fill in form.htm">here.</a></p>
        <h2>File your registration application</h2>
        <p>If you have completed the registration application on-line, just click the Submit button.</p>
        <p>If you have completed the registration application on paper, you can file it:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>in person - you can deliver it in any community office in Poland, regardless of where you live. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>You will need to present to an officer the original document (or its notarised copy) confirming your status of a foreigner. It can be </p>
        <ul>
            <li>a Polish card,</li>
            <li>a permit for a temporary stay in Poland, </li>
            <li>if you are married to a Polish citizen - your marriage certificate and a document confirming your spouse's identity. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The officer will scan the document and attach it to your registration application.&#160;This will accelerate processing your application.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>by post - you can send it to any community office. If you choose this method, you must sign your registration application in the presence of a notary, who will confirm authenticity of your signature.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>What next</h2>
        <p>Once you filed your registration application, the process is over. </p>
        <p>The office will verify your application. If there are any errors in your application filed online, you will be informed by an automated message. If you filed your application in person or by post, the office will contact you and ask you to correct any errors or omissions. You will have 7 business days to do it.</p>
        <p>If your application was correct, your business will be entered in CEIDG.</p>
        <p>The entry will be visible on the next business day following the date when your application was filed. </p>
        <p>You can start your busines on the same day when you filed your registration application.</p>
        <p>CEIDG will forward your data to the relevant tax office. The office will assign you a NIP&#160;number, if you have not yet had one. </p>
        <p>CEIDG&#160;will forward your data to the Polish Statistical Office (GUS). You will be assigned a REGON&#160;number. </p>
