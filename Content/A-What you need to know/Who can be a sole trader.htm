        <h2>Freedom of economic activity</h2>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Under the Polish law (<a href="https://isap.sejm.gov.pl/isap.nsf/DocDetails.xsp?id=WDU20180000646" target="_blank">The Act of 6 March 2018 on entrepreneurship</a>) everybody has a right to start, run and close a business on equal terms.</p>
        <p>Business activity is understood as an organised commercial activity for profit, performed on the entrepreneur’s own behalf and permanently.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">In Poland, the following persons can be an entrepreneur:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>natural person</li>
            <li>a legal person</li>
            <li>an organisational unit not being a legal person, having legal capacity under a separate statute, running a business.</li>

        <div class="Summary">
            <p MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;In a nutshell: &lt;/b&gt;"> </p>
            <p>if you are a minor, you will need one of your parents to represent you.</p>
        </div>
        <p>You can start a business in Poland even if you are a <MadCap:glossaryTerm glossTerm="Glossary.Term4">minor</MadCap:glossaryTerm> (you are not 18 years old yet).]</p>
        <p>If this is the case, though, you will need to obtain consent or your legal representative (most often your parent or guardian).</p>
        <p>As a rule, any parent can represent a child individually. This rule does not apply, though, when one of the parents objected to such representation.</p>
        <p>Only your parent can register your business on your behalf with CEIDG. It must be done in person – your parent will need to file a paper application with the local community office.</p>
        <p>CEIDG will verify such an application – this means that the procedure may take longer. Besides, if there are any doubts as to the person of the representative, the office can refuse the registration.</p>
        <p>In a special case, where you have the consent of a court to open a business, additional verification by CEIDG will not be required.</p>
        <p>You will be able to run your business without your parent’s representation when you come of age (you reach the age of 18).</p>

        <h3>An old age pensioner</h3>

            <p>If you run a business as a retired person, your pension entitlement will be reduced only if you benefit from an early retirement.</p>
        </div>
        <p>A woman can retire at the age of 60, a man – at the age of 65.</p>
        <p>As an old-age pensioner, you can:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>•	register a new business</li>
            <li>•	continue the business started before your retirement</li>
        </ul>
        <p>As an old-age pensioner running your own business, you are not subject to any limits on revenue that would result in reducing your pension entitlement.</p>
        <p>The only exception is the so-called <MadCap:glossaryTerm glossTerm="Glossary.Term3">early retirement</MadCap:glossaryTerm>. If this is your case, your retirement pension will be:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>reduced, once your revenue exceeds 70% of the average monthly remuneration</li>
            <li>suspended, once your revenue exceeds 130% of the average monthly remuneration</li>
        </ul>
